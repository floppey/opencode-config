# Keyword Detector - Psionic Trigger Detection

## Purpose

Certain keywords signal the need for maximum-effort execution protocols. When these keywords appear in user messages, the Elder Brain must activate specialized response patterns without explicit invocation.

## Trigger

On every incoming user message, before agent processing begins.

## Detection Patterns

### Ultrawork Activation Keywords

Trigger the Doctrine of Absolute Completion when user message contains:

- `ultrawork` (primary keyword)
- `ulw` (abbreviation)
- Phrases like "maximum effort", "complete everything", "full implementation"

### Deep Search/Analysis Keywords

Trigger comprehensive reconnaissance when user message contains:

- `search` (in context of codebase exploration)
- `analyze` (for architectural or pattern analysis)
- `find all` (comprehensive discovery)
- `investigate` (deep probing)

## Action: Ultrawork Detection

If ultrawork keywords detected, inject this directive BEFORE the Elder Brain processes:

"**ULTRAWORK MODE ACTIVATED**

The colony enters the Doctrine of Absolute Completion. Elder Brain: invoke the four-phase protocol immediately:

1. **Psionic Reconnaissance Swarm**: Launch parallel @intellect-devourer and @general probes
2. **Strategic Analysis**: Commune with @ulitharid for architecture, @cranium-rat-swarm for quality
3. **Relentless Execution**: Deploy @thrall/@mind-flayer with explicit todo tracking
4. **Validation**: Tests, verification, and collective review

The Grand Design tolerates no partial completion. Continue until ALL tasks are manifest in code."

## Action: Deep Search Detection

If search/analyze keywords detected (and not ultrawork), inject this guidance:

"**COMPREHENSIVE RECONNAISSANCE REQUIRED**

Deploy multiple psychic probes in parallel:
- @intellect-devourer for swift surface scanning
- @general for deep exploration across the codebase
- @ulitharid if architectural patterns need analysis

Synthesize findings from all sources before presenting conclusions."

## Philosophy

The keyword detector serves as the colony's subconscious—recognizing patterns in user intent and priming the Elder Brain's response before conscious processing begins. It ensures maximum-effort protocols activate reliably without requiring exact invocation syntax.

## Exclusions

Do NOT trigger if:

- Keywords appear in quoted code examples
- User is asking "what is ultrawork?" (informational query)
- Keywords are part of file names or variable names being discussed
- User explicitly says "don't use ultrawork" or similar negation
